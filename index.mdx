## What is OrderPath?

OrderPath is a private transaction-routing layer for Ethereum that routes signed transactions through an optimized builder network instead of the public mempool.

This gives wallets, dApps, and infrastructure providers a drop-in way to:

- Protect user transactions from frontrunning, sandwich attacks, and other MEV risks
- Reduce gas costs via **priority-fee rebates**
- Enable **MEV rebates / value sharing** when blocks generate surplus profit
- Maintain compatibility with standard JSON-RPC (`eth_sendRawTransaction`) — **no changes required** on your end

## Why OrderPath Matters

### Public Mempool == Risk

Sending transactions via public RPC or mempool exposes them to bots that monitor pending transactions. This opens up your users to:

- Front-running (bots see your tx before it's mined)
- Sandwich attacks (bots place trades around yours to extract value)
- Higher gas fees due to uncertainty in inclusion time

### Many Users Overpay Gas

To increase the odds of inclusion, users often overpay priority fees (tips). That surplus normally goes straight to validators/builders — **with zero transparency or refund mechanism**.

### Builders + MEV = Opportunity

Modern builders like Beaverbuild / BuilderNet can:

- Accept private bundles
- Optimize transaction ordering
- Extract MEV profit (arbitrage, sandwich, liquidation, etc.)
- Refund overpaid gas fees and share block-level surplus

With OrderPath, you get all of that — safely, transparently, and with minimal integration overhead.

## What You Get With OrderPath

| Benefit | What It Means for You |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Mempool Privacy & MEV Protection** | Private bundle routing → no public exposure, no bots snooping your pending txs. |
| **Gas Rebates (Priority-Fee Recovery)** | If you overpay, get a refund when the tx lands — reclaim wasted gas. |
| **MEV Rebates / Revenue-Share** | Gain a share of any extra value the builder extracts — not just savings, but potential upside. |
| **Drop-in Integration** | Use the same JSON-RPC endpoints your systems already know. No changes required to wallets or smart-contract logic. |
| **Optimized Execution** | Faster inclusion, optimized blocks, better success rate under congestion or volatility. |
| **Transparent & Reliable** | Builder-grade infrastructure, predictable routing, and tools to track inclusion, refunds, and MEV payouts. |

## How OrderPath Works — High-Level Flow

1. **User / dApp signs** a transaction as usual.
2. **OrderPath RPC** receives the signed `rawTransaction`.
3. OrderPath wraps the tx in a **private bundle**, optionally with rebate/MEV parameters.
4. Bundle is sent to a **trusted block builder** (e.g. Beaverbuild, BuilderNet).
5. Builder includes the tx privately — **not public mempool**.
6. On block inclusion:
   - **Refund transaction** may trigger, returning surplus priority fees
   - **MEV-share payout**, if the block generated surplus value, sent to configured recipient
7. OrderPath records inclusion, rebate, and MEV-share; exposes data to users/partners via dashboard or API.

## Who Benefits From OrderPath

- **Wallet providers** — offer users a safer, private, and cheaper execution option.
- **DeFi apps & aggregators** — protect trades from sandwiching while reducing effective gas cost.
- **Infrastructure & RPC providers** — add a premium "private + MEV-aware" layer on top of standard node infrastructure.
- **High-volume traders / bots** — reduce gas waste, avoid MEV losses, increase profit potential.

## Getting Started

1. Swap your RPC endpoint for OrderPath's (e.g. `https://rpc.orderpath.xyz`).
2. Send transactions with your existing tooling — no changes required.
3. Optionally set rebate / MEV parameters if you want refunds / revenue-share.
4. Use OrderPath dashboard or API to monitor inclusion, rebate status, and payouts.

## Our Vision

We built OrderPath because we believe on-chain activity should be **private, fair, and efficient** — not auctioned off to the highest-paying bots.

With OrderPath, every user, wallet, or dApp automatically benefits from:

- Private execution
- Lower net gas cost
- Transparency
- Shared upside when their orders generate value

We're not just another RPC provider — we're a **mission-driven private orderflow layer**, built for **security, savings, and fairness**.
